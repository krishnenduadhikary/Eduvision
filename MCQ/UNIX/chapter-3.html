                        topicName: "Displaying and Creating Files – cat Command",
                        questions: [
                            {
                                id: "cat_q1", question: "1. Which command is used for displaying contents of a file?",
                                options: ["cp", "rm", "cat", "mkdir"], correctAnswer: "cat",
                                explanation: "cat command is used to display the contents of a file. For displaying the contents, simply invoke the cat command with the filename (whose contents are to be displayed) as an argument. For example, if abd.txt file contains “HELLO WORLD” then,\n$ cat abd.txt\nHELLO WORLD"
                            },

                                id: "cat_q2", question: "2. Apart from displaying file contents, cat command is also used for _____ files.",
                                options: ["displaying", "deleting", "copying", "creating"], correctAnswer: "creating",
                                explanation: "cat command is one of the most well-known commands of the UNIX system. It is generally used to display the contents of a file on the terminal but can also be used for creating files. Suppose to create a file abd.txt, type the following command\n$ cat  >  abd.txt\nNow the prompt vanishes. cat command now waits for the input to be entered by the user. After the input is entered, the user hits the ctrl-D button which marks the end of the file and thus the file and the contents entered by the user are saved."
                            },
                            {
                                id: "cat_q3", question: "3. Multiple arguments as filenames can be specified in cat command.",
                                options: ["True", "False"], correctAnswer: "True",
                                explanation: "cat, like several other UNIX commands can accept more than one filename as arguments. For example,\n$ cat   file1   file2\nAbove command shows the contents of the second file immediately after the contents of the first file without any header information i.e. it concatenates the contents of two files on the terminal."
                            },
                            {
                                id: "cat_q4", question: "4. Which symbol is used with cat command for creating files?",
                                options: [">", "<", "*", "/"], correctAnswer: ">",
                                explanation: "> symbol acts as a redirection symbol and records the input entered by the user in the specified file. For example,\n$ cat  > file_01\nUNIX is a powerful operating system        // input entered by the user\n[CTRL-D]"
                            },
                            {
                                id: "cat_q5", question: "5. If we create a file using cat command with the same filename which already exists in the current directory then,",
                                options: ["existing file is deleted", "new file will be created separately", "existing file will be overwritten", "an error will be produced"], correctAnswer: "existing file will be overwritten",
                                explanation: "As cat command is also used to create files, so if we want to create a file with the same filename which already exists in the directory then the existing file will be overwritten."
                            },
                            {
                                id: "cat_q6", question: "6. Which symbol is used to append an existing file?",
                                options: [">", "<", ">>", "$"], correctAnswer: ">>",
                                explanation: "cat command overwrites the existing file if we try to create another file with a similar filename as an existing file. To avoid this we can use the >> operator. For example, if file01 already exists and we want to append it, then use the following command:\n$ cat  >> file01"
                            },
                            {
                                id: "cat_q7", question: "7. Which option is used with cat command for displaying non-printable characters?",
                                options: ["-v", "-n", "-x", "-a"], correctAnswer: "-v",
                                explanation: "If the file that we want to display contains nonprintable ASCII characters, then to display those characters we use -v option with the cat command. -n option is used for displaying the contents of the file along with line numbers."

                                explanation: "cp command is basically used for creating a copy of source file or a group of files. The syntax of the command requires at least two filenames to be specified. If both the files specified are ordinary files, the first file will be copied to the second file. The syntax of cp command is cp source_filename destination_filename. The contents of the source file will be copied to the destination file in the same directory.\n$ cp  file_01  file_02               // copies file_01 to file_02"

                                explanation: "If the destination file does not exist, then cp command will automatically create a file with the same name and then it copies the contents of the source file to the file which is created.

An asterisk (“*”) is a wildcard – a special character which expands to match other characters. For example, cp file* directory_one will copy all the files whose name will be starting with ‘file’ into ‘directory_one’ file."

It does not bother about subsequent mismatches but displays only the first mismatch.

                                explanation: "We can limit the number of bytes to be compared by the cmp command by using -n option with it. For example, if we want to compare at most 50 bytes then the command will be written as:\n$ cmp  -n 50  file01  file02"

For this facility, we use -i option followed by the number of bytes to be skipped. For example, to skip the first 10 bytes use the following command,\ncmp  -i  10  file01  file02"

For example,\n$ cmp -b  file01  file02\nfile01  file02 differ: Byte 20, Line 2 is 256 z 268 w\nIn the above output, the difference is in 17th byte, which is ‘z’ in file01 and ‘w’ in file02 respectively.

For example, if we want to compare two files namely file01 and file02 then the first column will contain those entries which are unique to file01 whereas the second column will contain those entries which are unique to file02.
