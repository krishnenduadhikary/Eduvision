                                options: ["group of commands", "a file containing special symbols", "a file containing a series of commands", "group of functions"], correctAnswer: "a file containing a series of commands",
                                explanation: "When we have to execute a series of commands altogether, we store them in a file which is itself executed as a shell script. A shell script is basically a computer program designed to be run by the UNIX shell."

                                explanation: "It’s not mandatory to save script files with .sh extension but we do so for our own convention as it makes it easy to match them with wildcards."

                                explanation: "Shell scripts are executed in a separate child process, and this sub-shell need not be of the same type as our login shell. In other words, even if our login shell is bourne, we can use a Korn sub-shell to run our script."

                                explanation: "When the comment character (#) is placed anywhere in a line; the shell ignores all characters on its right. However, this rule doesn’t apply to the first line which is the interpreter line. It always begins with #! and followed by the pathname of the shell to be used for running the script.\n#!/bin/sh                   // first line defining the pathname\n# script.sh                // name of the script"

                                options: ["chmod +x", "chmod +r", "chmod +w", "chmod +rwx"], correctAnswer: "chmod +x",
                                explanation: "Before we run the script, it is essential to make the script executable first. After that invoke the script name to run the script. For making the script executable, we have to use chmod +x script_name."
                            },

                                options: ["ps", "pr", "sh", "$$"], correctAnswer: "sh",
                                explanation: "We know that shell scripts are executed by a child shell. But we can also explicitly spawn a child of our own choice by using the sh command along with script name as an argument. When used in this way, the interpreter line is ignored by the shell."
                            },

There can be a problem especially when the output of the command begins with a-.It may happen that set interprets it as an option.
