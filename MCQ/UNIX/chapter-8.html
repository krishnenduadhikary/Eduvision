                                options: ["interactive, responsive", "interpreter, executing", "scripting, interpreter", "high level, low level"], correctAnswer: "scripting, interpreter",
                                explanation: "The UNIX shell is both an interpreter and scripting language. We can also say that shell can be interactive or non-interactive. When we log in to our system, interactive shell presents a prompt and wait for our requests while a non-interactive shell is managed by an interactive shell while executing a shell script."

                                explanation: "Bash was developed by GNU as a bourne again shell. It was a grand superset in that that contains the features of both C and Korn shells. Bash was developed to ultimately conform to the POSIX shell specification and is arguably the best shell to use."

                                explanation: "To create a child shell we can use the sh command. sh is basically the command name of Bourne shell. sh is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a command line string. To create a child shell, simply invoke sh command without any argument."

                                explanation: "Shell variables are of two types –local and environment. For example, PATH, HOME and SHELL are environment variables. They are called so because they are available in the user’s total environment whereas local variables are more restricted in scope."
                            },

                                explanation: "Bash and Korn shell also supports history facility that treats a previous command as an event and associates it with a number. Thus we can recall and execute previous commands by their event numbers. Using the !, we can set the PS1 prompt to show the current event number.

                                options: ["names", "inode number", "links", "uid"], correctAnswer: "links",
                                explanation: "A filename is not stored in the inode because a file can have multiple filenames. When this happens, we say that the file has more than one link, which means that we can access this file using multiple filenames. The number of links associated with a file can be viewed using ls command."

                                explanation: "A file is linked with the ln (link) command, which takes two filenames as arguments. The command can create both hard and soft links. The syntax for creating a hard link is as follows:\n$ ln original_filename  link_name    \n$ ln  emp.lst  employee        //employee must not exist"
                            },

                                options: ["-a", "-l", "-s", "-e"], correctAnswer: "-s",
                                explanation: "We can also create soft links using ln command. All we have to do is to use -s option along with ln command. For example,\n$ ln  -s  original_filename  link_name\n$ ln  -s emp.lst  employee"
                            },

                                explanation: "Each hard linked file is assigned the same inode number as the original one, hence they refer to the same physical location. Hard links are more flexible as compared to soft links, as they remain linked even after the original file is removed."
                            },

                                options: ["True", "False"], correctAnswer: "True",
                                explanation: "A symbolic link or soft link is same as a shortcut feature in Windows OS. Each soft linked file contains a separate inode number which points to the original file. Soft links are used when we want to link files across the file systems. Soft Link contains the path for original file and not the contents of the file."

                                explanation: "When we create a file or a directory, the permissions assigned to them depend on the system’s default settings. The default permissions for regular files in UNIX system are 666 (in octal) or rw-rw-rw- and for directories are 777 (in octal) or rwxrwxrwx."
                            },

                                options: ["umask", "um", "perm", "touch"], correctAnswer: "umask",
                                explanation: "The permissions of a file/ directory are managed at the time when we create these. The permissions are transformed by subtracting the user mask from it to remove one or more permissions. For example,\n$ umask\n022\nThis is an octal number which is subtracted from the system default to obtain the actual default. Hence it will become 644 for ordinary files and 755 for directories. Now if we create any file or directory, the permissions associated will be 644 and 755 respectively."

                                explanation: "When touch command is used without options but with an expression, it changes both access and modification times. The expression is an eight number using the format MMDDhhmm (month, day, hour and minute). For example,\n$ touch 03161430  emp.txt ; ls -l emp.txt\nrw-rw-rw-  1  kumar  metal  870 Mar 16 14:30  emp.txt"

                                options: ["-a", "-o", "&&", "!"], correctAnswer: "!",
                                explanation: "There are three operators that are commonly used with the find command. The ! operator is used before an option to negate its meaning. For example,\n$ find . ! -name “*.c” -print        // select all files but not the C program files."

                                explanation: "The -a operator when used with find command represents the AND condition and is implied by default when two selection criteria are placed together. For example,\n$ find . \\(-type f  -a -mtime  +2)\\  -print            // -a \n can also be omitted ( it is automatically implied by  //  default)"

                                explanation: "The -o operator when used with find command represents the OR condition. It is used when we need to specify two or more conditions with an option. An escaped pair of parenthesis is used whenever we use the -o or -a option."

                                options: ["-exec", "-atime", "-mtime", "-a"], correctAnswer: "-exec",
                                explanation: "The -exec option is one of the major option used with the find command. It lets us take any action by running a UNIX command on the selected files. -exec takes the command to execute as its own argument, followed by {} and \\;. For example,\n$ find  $HOME  -type  f  -atime +365  -exec rm {} \\;\nAbove command will remove all ordinary files not accessed for more than a year."

                                explanation: "find’s -ok option seeks confirmation before taking the action specified. This provides the user with a facility of giving confirmation before anything goes wrong. For example,\n$ find  $HOME  -type  f  -atime +365  -ok rm {} \\;\nAbove command will ask for the user confirmation before removing each selected file."
