            <h2>Basic Computer Architecture</h2>
            <h3>1.9 Components of Computer (Broad Overview)</h3>
            <p>The components of a computer work together to process data. The main components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input Unit:</strong> Used to input data into the computer. Example: Keyboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> Used to process the data. The CPU is comprised of 3 main
                    units.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Unit:</strong> A device which generates the output. Example: Printer.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Diagram: Input Unit, CPU (Memory Unit, Control Unit, Arithmetic & Logic
                Unit), Output Unit connected.</div>

            <h3>The Von Neumann Architecture</h3>
            <p>The task of entering and altering programs for early computers like ENIAC was extremely tedious. The
                programming process can be easy if the program could be represented in a form suitable for storing in
                memory alongside the data. Then, a computer could get its instructions by reading them from memory, and
                a program could be set or altered by setting the values of a portion of memory. This idea is known as
                the <strong>stored-program concept</strong>. The first publication of the idea was in a 1945 proposal by
                von Neumann for a new computer, the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Computer).</p>
            <p>In 1946, von Neumann and his colleagues began the design of a new stored-program computer, referred to as
                the IAS computer, at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies. The IAS computer, although not
                completed until 1952, is the prototype of all subsequent general-purpose computers.</p>

        <section id="cpu" class="content-section">
            <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
            <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) or the processor is also often called the brain of the computer. CPU
                (Figure 2.1) consists of Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU). In addition, CPU also has a
                set of registers which are temporary storage areas for holding data, and instructions. ALU performs the
                arithmetic and logic operations on the data that is made available to it. CU is responsible for
                organizing the processing of data and instructions. CU controls and coordinates the activity of the
                other units of computer. CPU uses the registers to store the data, instructions during processing.</p>
            <p>CPU executes the stored program instructions, i.e. instructions and data are stored in memory before
                execution. For processing, CPU gets data and instructions from the memory. It interprets the program
                instructions and performs the arithmetic and logic operations required for the processing of data. Then,
                it sends the processed data or result to the memory. CPU also acts as an administrator and is
                responsible for supervising operations of other parts of the computer.</p>
            <p>The CPU is fabricated as a single Integrated Circuit (IC) chip, and is also known as the microprocessor.
                The microprocessor is plugged into the motherboard of the computer (Motherboard is a circuit board that
                has electronic circuit etched on it and connects the microprocessor with the other hardware components).
            </p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Figure 2.1 CPU: Block diagram showing Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit,
                and Registers.</div>

            <h3>2.2.1 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
            <p>ALU consists of two units—arithmetic unit and logic unit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Arithmetic unit</strong> performs arithmetic operations on the data that is made
                    available to it. Some of the arithmetic operations supported by the arithmetic unit are—addition,
                    subtraction, multiplication and division.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Logic unit</strong> of ALU is responsible for performing logic operations. Logic unit
                    performs comparisons of numbers, letters and special characters. Logic operations include testing
                    for greater than, less than or equal to condition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations, and uses registers to hold the data that is being
                processed.</p>

            <h3>2.2.2 Registers</h3>
            <p>Registers are high-speed storage areas within the CPU, but have the least storage capacity. Registers are
                not referenced by their address, but are directly accessed and manipulated by the CPU during instruction
                execution. Registers store data, instructions, addresses and intermediate results of processing.
                Registers are often referred to as the CPU’s working memory. The data and instructions that require
                processing must be brought in the registers of CPU before they can be processed. For example, if two
                numbers are to be added, both numbers are brought in the registers, added and the result is also placed
                in a register.</p>
            <p>Registers are used for different purposes, with each register serving a specific purpose. Some of the
                important registers in CPU (Figure 2.2) are as follows—</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accumulator (ACC)</strong> stores the result of arithmetic and logic operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Instruction Register (IR)</strong> contains the current instruction most recently fetched.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Program Counter (PC)</strong> contains the address of next instruction to be processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Address Register (MAR)</strong> contains the address of next location in the memory
                    to be accessed.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Buffer Register (MBR)</strong> temporarily stores data from memory or the data to be
                    sent to memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Register (DR)</strong> stores the operands and any other data.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Figure 2.2 CPU registers: Blocks for PC, IR, MAR, ACC, MBR, DR.</div>
            <p>The number of registers and the size of each (number of bits) register in a CPU helps to determine the
                power and the speed of a CPU. The overall number of registers can vary from about ten to many hundreds,
                depending on the type and complexity of the processor. The size of the register, also called word size,
                indicates the amount of data with which the computer can work at any given time. The bigger the size,
                the more quickly it can process data. The size of a register may be 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. For example, a
                32-bit CPU is one in which each register is 32 bits wide and its CPU can manipulate 32 bits of data at a
                time. Nowadays, PCs have 32-bit or 64-bit registers. 32-bit processor and 64-bit processor are the terms
                used to refer to the size of the registers. Other factors remaining the same, a 64-bit processor can
                process the data twice as fast as one with 32-bit processor.</p>

            <h3>2.2.3 Control Unit (CU)</h3>
            <p>The control unit of a computer does not do any actual processing of data. It organizes the processing of
                data and instructions. It acts as a supervisor and, controls and coordinates the activity of the other
                units of computer. CU coordinates the input and output devices of a computer. It directs the computer to
                carry out stored program instructions by communicating with the ALU and the registers. CU uses the
                instructions in the Instruction Register (IR) to decide which circuit needs to be activated. It also
                instructs the ALU to perform the arithmetic or logic operations. When a program is run, the Program
                Counter (PC) register keeps track of the program instruction to be executed next. CU tells when to fetch
                the data and instructions, what to do, where to store the results, the sequencing of events during
                processing etc. CU also holds the CPU’s Instruction Set, which is a list of all operations that the CPU
                can perform.</p>
            <h4>Key functions of the Control Unit:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsible for controlling all parts of the computer.</li>
                <li>Responsible in managing and coordinating with all the units of the computer.</li>
                <li>Gets instructions from the memory, interprets them, and accordingly directs the operation of the
                    computer.</li>
                <li>Responsible in communication with input/output devices for transfer of data or results from storage.
                </li>
                <li>Does not process or store data.</li>

            <h2>Memory System</h2>
            <h3>2.3 Memory Unit</h3>
            <p>The memory unit consists of cache memory and primary memory. Primary memory or main memory of the
                computer is used to store the data and instructions during execution of the instructions. Random Access
                Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) are the primary memory. In addition to the main memory, there is
                another kind of storage device known as the secondary memory. Secondary memory is non-volatile and is
                used for permanent storage of data and programs. A program or data that has to be executed is brought
                into the RAM from the secondary memory.</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Diagram: Types of memory (Primary Memory [CPU, Register, On Chip Cache, RAM
                {DRAM, SRAM}], ROM {PROM, EPROM, EEPROM}), Secondary Memory [Magnetic Tape, Magnetic Disk, Optical
                Disk]).</div>

            <h3>A Brief Overview How Processing Takes Place in Computer to Give Output:</h3>
            <p>During the time of processing raw data from the RAM, some data from RAM is brought to cache memory prior
                to processing to increase processing speed. This memory keeps on filling up and gets emptied by the
                control unit till all the instructions and raw data from the RAM get emptied. RAM on the other hand gets
                filled up with instructions and raw data from the virtual memory (A Portion occupied in the hard disk)
                by the control unit till the program is completely executed.</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Diagram: Hard Disk -> Control Unit -> Virtual Memory -> Input -> RAM
                (Random Access Memory) -> Cache -> ALU (Arithmetic logic unit) -> Output. Arrows show data flow.</div>
            <p>Hard disk: A device to store huge amount of data and instructions. Data from the input unit is taken by
                the control unit and stored in hard disk or sent to RAM for processing. When working with heavy data and
                instruction from hard disk RAM is a small place and so when data and instructions are too heavy to be
                stored in RAM and so they are stored in the virtual memory a Portion of hard disk for faster execution.
                Instructions and data in RAM (Random Access Memory) go to the cache memory for processing. Instructions
                and data from cache memory go to the ALU for processing. After processing from ALU the output is
                generated on printer/ monitor or stored to a hard drive. Once instruction in RAM are over they are
                filled from virtual memory. The cycle continues till all instructions are executed.</p>

            <h3>Primary Memory</h3>
            <p>Primary memory is the memory that is accessed by the processor directly. It is also known as main memory
                or internal memory. It helps in executing applications that are temporarily stored in a specific memory
                location. Primary memory is of two types – RAM and ROM.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Volatile memory used to store data and programs
                    currently being used by the CPU. Data is lost when power is turned off.</li>
                <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> Non-volatile memory containing pre-written instructions
                    essential for booting up the computer. Data persists even when power is off. Sub-types include PROM,
                    EPROM, EEPROM.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cache Memory</h3>
            <p>Caching is a technology based on the memory subsystem of the computer. The main purpose of a cache is to
                accelerate the computer while keeping the price of the computer low. Caching allows to do the computer
                tasks more rapidly. Cache technology is the use of a faster but smaller memory type to accelerate a
                slower but larger memory type. When using a cache, we must check the cache to see if an item is in
                there. If it is there, it’s called a cache hit. If not, it is called a cache miss and the computer must
                wait for a round trip from the larger, slower memory area. A cache has some maximum size that is much
                smaller than the larger storage area. It is possible to have multiple layers of cache.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of subsystems in a computer; one can put cache between many of them to improve
                performance. Here’s an example. We have the microprocessor (the fastest thing in the computer). Then
                there’s the L1 cache that caches the L2 cache that caches the main memory which can be used (and is
                often used) as a cache for even slower peripherals like hard disks and CD-ROMs. The hard disks are also
                used to cache an even slower medium – Internet connection. A list of different types of cache is given
                as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>L1 cache</strong> - Memory accesses at full microprocessor speed (10 nanoseconds, 4
                    kilobytes to 16 kilobytes in size)</li>
                <li><strong>L2 cache</strong> - Memory access of type SRAM (around 20 to 30 nanoseconds, 128 kilobytes
                    to 512 kilobytes in size)</li>
                <li><strong>Main memory</strong> - Memory access of type RAM (around 60 nanoseconds, 32 megabytes to 128
                    megabytes in size)</li>
                <li><strong>Hard disk</strong> - Mechanical, slow (around 12 milliseconds, 1 gigabyte to 10 gigabytes in
                    size)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="storage-devices" class="content-section">
            <h2>Storage Devices (Secondary Memory)</h2>
            <p>The secondary memory stores data and instructions permanently. The information can be stored in secondary
                memory for a long time (years), and is generally permanent in nature unless erased by the user. It is a
                non-volatile memory. It provides back-up storage for data and instructions. Hard disk drive, floppy
                drive and optical disk drives are some examples of storage devices. The data and instructions that are
                currently not being used by CPU, but may be required later for processing, are stored in secondary
                memory. Secondary memory has a high storage capacity than the primary memory. Secondary memory is also
                cheaper than the primary memory. It takes longer time to access the data and instructions stored in
                secondary memory than in primary memory. Magnetic tape drives, disk drives and optical disk drives are
                the different types of storage devices.</p>

            <h3>3.5 Storage Systems Classification</h3>
            <p>Storage systems are the devices—such as hard disks, optical disks and magnetic disks—used for data
                storage. The main objective of the storage system is to permanently store data—which can be of any type,
                such as images, videos and text—for future use. The storage systems provide the facility to use the data
                at any time. Different storage systems have varying storage capacities. For example, the normal storage
                capacity of Compact Disk (CD) is 700 Megabytes (MB).</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Fig. 3.7 Classification of storage systems: Storage Devices branching into
                Magnetic, Solid state, Optical, Magneto Optical. Magnetic into Tapes, Disks. Optical into Read only
                Disks, Read once Write Many Disks.</div>

            <h3>3.6 Magnetic Storage Systems</h3>
            <p>Magnetic storage systems can be defined as the storage systems that store the data on a magnetised
                medium, with the help of magnetised particles. Magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, hard disks, floppy disks
                are examples of magnetic storage systems. The magnetic storage systems are non-volatile and provide the
                facility to store any type of data, such as text, audio, video, image, etc. In case of magnetic storage
                systems, data can be accessed randomly as well as sequentially. For example, we can access data
                sequentially from a magnetic tape and randomly from a magnetic disk. When data is accessed sequentially,
                the access time is directly proportional to the searching point. In other words, if the searching point
                is near, then the access time is less, and if the searching point is far, then the access time is more.
                On the other hand, when data is accessed randomly, the access time is less.</p>
            <h4>3.6.1 Magnetic Tapes</h4>
            <p>Magnetic tapes are the plastic tapes with magnetic coating that are used for storing the data, such as
                text, audio or video. Performance is not a major issue. Magnetic tapes are best suited as the backup
                devices for storing a large amount of data.</p>

            <h3>3.9 Solid-State Storage (SSD) Devices</h3>
            <p>SSD can be defined as the device that contains all the properties of hard disk drives to store the data
                and use solid-state memory. These devices do not use magnetic and optical medium to store data. The main
                objective of these devices is to process the instructions electronically. SSDs have no mechanical parts
                due to which access time in case of SSDs is less. Examples are flash memory cards and Universal Serial
                Bus (USB) devices. SSDs are widely used in laptops to store data.</p>
            <h4>3.9.1 Structure of SSD</h4>
            <p>Based on DRAM and NAND flash memory. Flash memory based SSD is slower, as compared to the DRAM volatile
                memory.</p>
            <h4>3.9.2 Advantages of SSD</h4>
            <p>Better performance (random access, searching, spin-up), Low power and heat, High reliability (no moving
                parts), Small dimension, Small form factor.</p>
            <h4>3.9.3 Disadvantages of SSD</h4>
            <p>High price, Low storage capacity (compared to HDD cost), Low writing speed (flash memory), Low storage
                density, Vulnerable to power loss, electrostatic discharge, magnetic fields.</p>

            <h3>USB (Universal Serial Bus)</h3>
            <p>USB, short for Universal Serial Bus. USB was designed to standardize the connection of computer
                peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, Portable media players,
                disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric
                power. It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles.
                USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel Ports, as well
                as separate power chargers for Portable devices.</p>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Table/Diagram: USB Ports (Male ports: USB-A, USB-A-male(mini),

            <h2>Computer Hardware and Software</h2>
            <p>Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer, i.e. the components that can be
                seen and touched.</p>
            <h4>Examples of Hardware:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Input devices - keyboard, mouse, etc.</li>
                <li>Output devices - printer, monitor, etc.</li>
                <li>Secondary storage devices - Hard disk, CD, DVD, etc.</li>
                <li>Internal components - CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="diagram-placeholder">Visual: Components of Computer (Mainboard, Monitor, CPU, DVD-RW, CD-RW,
                RAM, VGA Card, Sound Card, Harddisk, Mouse, Speaker, Keyboard, Power Supply, DVD ROM Drive, Reader
                all-in-one Internal - all radiating from a central PC Tower).</div>

            <p>Software is a set of programs, which is designed to perform a well-defined function. A program is a
                sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.</p>

            <h3>Relationship between Hardware and Software</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make
                    a computer produce a useful output.</li>
                <li>Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware.</li>
                <li>Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.</li>
                <li>To get a particular job done on the computer, relevant software should be loaded into the hardware.
                </li>
                <li>Hardware is a one-time expense. Software development is very expensive and is a continuing expense.
                </li>
                <li>Different software applications can be loaded on a hardware to run different jobs.</li>
                <li>A software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.</li>
                <li>If the hardware is the ‘heart’ of a computer system, then the software is its ‘soul’. Both are
                    complementary to each other.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Software</h3>
            <p>There are two types of software – System Software and Application Software.</p>
            <h4>System Software</h4>
            <p>The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing
                capabilities of the computer itself. System software is generally prepared by the computer
                manufacturers. These software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which
                interact with the hardware at a very basic level. System software serves as the interface between the
                hardware and the end users. Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers,
                Interpreter, Assemblers, etc.</p>
            <h5>Features of System Software:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Close to the system.</li>
                <li>Fast in speed.</li>
                <li>Difficult to design.</li>
                <li>Difficult to understand.</li>
                <li>Less interactive.</li>
                <li>Smaller in size.</li>
                <li>Difficult to manipulate.</li>
                <li>Generally written in low-level language.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Application Software</h4>
            <p>Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All
                software applications prepared in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software.
                Application software may consist of a single program, such as Microsoft’s notepad for writing and
                editing a simple text. It may also consist of a collection of programs, often called a software package,
                which work together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet package.</p>
            <h5>Examples of Application Software:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Payroll Software</li>
                <li>Student Record Software</li>
                <li>Inventory Management Software</li>
                <li>Income Tax Software</li>
                <li>Railways Reservation Software</li>
                <li>Microsoft Office Suite Software (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Features of Application Software:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Close to the user.</li>
                <li>Easy to design.</li>
                <li>More interactive.</li>
                <li>Slow in speed.</li>
                <li>Generally written in high-level language.</li>
                <li>Easy to understand.</li>
                <li>Easy to manipulate and use.</li>
                <li>Bigger in size and requires large storage space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Difference Between Hardware and Software</h3>
            <p>A computer system is divided into two categories: Hardware and Software. Hardware refers to the physical
                and visible components of the system such as a monitor, CPU, keyboard and mouse. Software, on the other
                hand, refers to a set of instructions which enable the hardware to perform a specific set of tasks. The
                software must be installed in the hardware to function properly and similarly, the hardware must be
                present for the software to perform. Both are interdependent, yet they are also different from each
                other.</p>
